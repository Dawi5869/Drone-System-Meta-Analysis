# 🧠 Meta-Analysis: Decentralized Control, Dynamic Planning, and Localization in Autonomous Drone Systems

## ✨ Overview
This independently conducted meta-analysis explores state-of-the-art methods in **autonomous drone systems**. It focuses on three critical subsystems:
1. **Path Planning Algorithms** – including classical and biologically inspired approaches.
2. **Centralized vs. Decentralized Architectures** – for multi-agent control systems.
3. **Localization Techniques** – including vision-based SLAM, LiDAR, IMU, and hybrid models.

The research draws from **16 peer-reviewed papers** to identify current trends, dominant strategies, and emerging research directions in drone swarm systems.
